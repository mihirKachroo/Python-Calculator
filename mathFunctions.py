This is the file where I have written my functions for adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, exponents, radicals, logarithms, modulus, floor division, and finding the greatest common factor and least common multiple.

I import all the functions from this file in main.py

# Function to add two numbers
def add(firstNumber, secondNumber):
  return "{} + {} = {}".format(firstNumber, secondNumber, float(firstNumber+secondNumber)) # Returns equation string and formats answer to float

def subtract(firstNumber, secondNumber):
  return "{} - {} = {}".format(firstNumber, secondNumber, float(firstNumber-secondNumber)) # Returns equation string and formats answer to float

# Function to multiply two numbers
def multiply(firstNumber, secondNumber):
  return "{} * {} = {}".format(firstNumber, secondNumber, float(firstNumber*secondNumber)) # Returns equation string and formats answer to float

# Function to divide two numbers
def divide(firstNumber, secondNumber):
  return "{} / {} = {}".format(firstNumber, secondNumber, float(firstNumber/secondNumber)) # Returns equation string and formats answer to float

# Function to get exponent
def exponent(base, power):
  return "{} ** {} = {}".format(base, power, float(base**power)) # Returns equation string and formats answer to float

# Function to solve radical expression
def radical(root, number):
  return "{}âˆš{} = {}".format(int(root), number, float(number ** (1/root))) # Returns equation string and formats answer to float

# Function to find logarithmic bases using math module
def log(base, a):
  return "Logarithm base {} of {} = {}".format(base, a, float(math.log(a, base))) # Returns equation string and formats answer to float

# Function to get remainder between two operands

    (firstNumber, secondNumber) = (secondNumber, firstNumber % secondNumber)

# Function to find the least common multiple between two numbers
